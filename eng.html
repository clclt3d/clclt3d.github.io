<h4>Data storage.</h4>
<p>Your data is stored on your device and is not shared with third parties. All responsibilities for privacy and data storage are assigned to the user. Protect your device! 
</p>

<p>Currently, the app runs on Android version 10 and higher. We also plan to release it for IOS; this event will be announced in advance.

<h4>Elements control </h4>
<p><font color="#c9211e">All changes are saved immediately and automatically.</font><br />

</p>
<img src="edit.png"  border="0"/>

<p>By clicking on an element, you go down a level in the project tree. The project tree consists of catalogs and elements.    
</p>
<h4>Catalog.</h4>
<p>The catalog is designed for easy storage of your projects. A catalog can contain other catalogs or elements. You can transfer all the information from the catalog, including the subsections. To do this, open the catalog in edit mode, select share -data file - clcltd. You can set a name and a note for the catalog.
</p>

<h4>Elements. </h4>
<p>The elements have a more extended usage and functions. Like catalogs, elements can be transferred as data files and set with a name and a note. Additionally, the element can be transferred in portable document format (PDF) and spreadsheet format, including all subsections. It can be assigned a sequential number in the list; by default, the number would be the maximum in the current section. The "active" parameter is intended for visual use; this element will be marked as crossed out in all lists or will not be displayed, depending on the settings. Set the color as desired. Mark the significance of this task with color or use it for other purposes.</p>

<p>The element screen contains two additional sub-screens - the list and totals. The list tab contains the products and services used in your project, add and remove them as needed.
</p>
<img src="help_html_e17b293a10568ef9.png"  border="0"/>

<p>After adding products or services, you can fill in the required fields: name, name dimension, quantity, unit price, and currency. For examples of solving various tasks, see the section - <a href="#examples">Usage examples</a>. The totals tab contains the totals of the entire project tree; the totals include both the current element and all sub-elements.
</p>

<p>You can increase or decrease the font in this report, as well as sort the list by name/quantity.
</p>


<h4>Menu.</h4>

<h4>The "clcltd" data file.</h4>
